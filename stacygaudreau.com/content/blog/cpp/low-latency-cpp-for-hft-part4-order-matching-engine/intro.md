heading: 'Part 4 - Order Matching Engine (OME)'
---

In this 4th part in the high frequency trading (HFT) with C++ series, I finally put the low latency system components we've built to use, by putting together the first component of the actual trading exchange: the **Order Matching Engine (OME)**!

The OME is an integral part of any market exchange, and is responsible for matching and executing orders for clients trading financial instruments.
