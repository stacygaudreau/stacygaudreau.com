This series will be documenting my learning adventures as I delve deep into the world of ultra **low-latency**, high performance C++. Along the way, I'll be building a **High Frequency Trading (HFT)** system from scratch.

While much of this information will be specific to HFT, it can apply to any system which demands deterministic low latency, or operates within tight resource constraints (eg: embedded systems).
