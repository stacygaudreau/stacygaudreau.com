## Project Goals

This project was created in order to gain further experience developing and deploying a decent sized production-grade web application written in Python. I wanted to create something much larger than a "to-do list" style app, which would be challenging enough to keep me interested in its development.

In addition to the [RateMyDerp app](https://ratemyderp.com) itself, a realtime dashboard -- powered by the [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) timeseries database -- displays live application metrics and KPIs.
