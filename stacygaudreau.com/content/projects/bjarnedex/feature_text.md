A desktop audio application built using **C++** and the **JUCE** framework.

There are two playback decks for the user to load with audio files from the integrated track library. Various effects can be applied along with equal-power crossfading between the two decks.

Track playlists can be edited, saved and loaded from disk, and are persisted between application loads.
