## Maker of Audio Synthesizer Electronics

Founded in 2011, over the next decade [Hexinverter Ã‰lectronique](https://hexinverter.net) invented, developed and shipped **more than a dozen** pro audio electronic products worldwide, making a name for ourselves in the world of [eurorack modular synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack).

As **founder** and **lead developer**, I was fortunate to challenge and grow my product design and programming skills with loads of first-hand experience.
