## Mindphaser -- My Parting Work

Our most long-awaited and challenging product design yet -- our _magnum opus_, if you will -- was in development since 2017, and shipped in early 2021.

It was the best of high notes to end on, and I am looking forward to the next adventure in my career.

### Development Highlights

Every new product comes with its own unique set of learning challenges and experiences during development. Some highlights and technical achievements of Mindphaser include --

- A core made of analog circuitry, with digital control enhanced by a 32bit **ARM Cortex** microcontroller
- An [interactive audio and visual product demonstration](https://mindphaser-preorder.hexinverter.net/), written in **JavaScript** and using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
- **Embedded C firmware** provides intuitive, modern user amenities and visual feedback
- Streamlined workflows between graphic user interface design and engineering software with automation

### Marketing & Release

Since Mindphaser spanned years of development, our usual marketing efforts were able to be pushed even further in terms of media and graphic design.

It was great to develop new workflows with our graphics contractor [Papernoise](http://papernoise.net), who we'd already worked with for nearly a decade.

Check out this short teaser video which explains the product's features.
