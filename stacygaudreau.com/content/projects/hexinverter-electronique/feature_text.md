Beginning in 2011, we invented, developed and shipped more than a dozen pro audio electronic products worldwide.

As **founder** and **lead developer**, this challenged and grew my product design and programming skills. I learned to solve engineering problems using circuit design enhanced with the digital intelligence of modern ARM Cortex embedded systems.

Invaluable first-hand lessons regarding **business** and **marketing** were also discovered.
