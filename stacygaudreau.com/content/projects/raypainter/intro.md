## Overview

This project features a 3D [raytracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) renderer written from scratch in C++, with unit testing throughout. It allows the construction of scenes and art using geometric primitives as well as imported 3D object files.

The library is functional and has its base set of features complete, with more in the works. A **GUI application** is being built around it to make a user-friendly experience for creating nice artwork with a familiar "graphics editing" style application interface.
