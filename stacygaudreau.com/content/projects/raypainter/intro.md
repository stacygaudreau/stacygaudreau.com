## The Raytracer Challenge, in C++

This project features a 3D renderer written from scratch in C++, with unit testing throughout. It allows the construction of scenes and art using geometric primitives as well as imported 3D object files.

The library is functional and nearly feature complete, and a GUI application is now being built around it to make a user-friendly experience for creating nice artwork with a familiar "graphics editing" style application interface.
