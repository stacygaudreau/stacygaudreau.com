Ray Painter is a software raytracing 3D renderer written from scratch in C++.

It was started in 2022 as my attempt at the _Raytracer Challenge_ by Jamis Buck.

The project currently exists as a C++ library. An accompanying cross-platform desktop GUI is in development. The drawing API is currently used as procedural code.
