## Android/iOS React Native stock trading application

TradeKeeper is a mobile native application for personal finance. The user can record stock and other financial transactions, as well as monitor portfolio valuation and performance over time.

It is currently **under development** and until the build is ready to package up and demo, [check out the interactive Figma prototype here](https://www.figma.com/proto/4hfvPhTWWOvbp6WgJK28bk/TradeKeeper?node-id=160-10848&starting-point-node-id=160%3A10848&mode=design&t=P4vymiaxEntPL2L2-1)!

The motivation for building this app was to further skills in **React** and **React Native**, working with 3rd party **REST APIs**, serverless backends and **NoSQL** (via **Firebase**).
