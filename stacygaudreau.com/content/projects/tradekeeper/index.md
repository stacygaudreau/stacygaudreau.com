## Features

## Development Stack

TradeKeeper features a serverless, full-stack architecture using React Native as a base for mobile application development. Specific technologies and resources used include

- React Native
- Expo/EAS Build
- NoSQL database (Firebase)
- React Native Navigation
- Backend API (Node.js functions via Firebase)
- Numerous open source NPM packages
- React Native Styled Components
- User authorization (Firebase)
- 3rd party stock market API (Tiingo)
- Figma for UI/UX design

## Design (UI & UX)

Besides the obvious technical achievements, one of the goals of this project was to further my skills with **Figma** and UI design in general, so I can be better integrated with future design teams I may work with.

A considerable amount of time and care went into the design of this project (mainly because I was learning so much Figma at the same time!).

### Figma prototype

You can [check out the interactive Figma prototype here](https://www.figma.com/proto/4hfvPhTWWOvbp6WgJK28bk/TradeKeeper?node-id=160-10848&starting-point-node-id=160%3A10848&mode=design&t=P4vymiaxEntPL2L2-1) if you haven't already.

### Brainstorming

For brainstorming and generally fleshing out ideas for the project, I used Figma's **FigJam** feature for the first time. It was pretty useful for "whiteboarding" a bunch of ideas and organizing them into a creative workflow.

### Logo, branding & typography

A generative model (DALL-E) was used to spark some ideas for the logo and primary colour, and then a unique but inspired logo was created manually using vector primitives in Figma.

The typography of any application is pretty important, so I spent a good bit of time playing with various font pairings while brainstorming. Figma was very helpful for this.

### App screen and UX design

All of the application's screens/views and components were designed and mocked up in Figma.
