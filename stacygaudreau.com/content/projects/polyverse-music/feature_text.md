At Polyverse Music, I served **as Senior C++ Developer**, specializing in **GUI/UX programming** on numerous products.

Polyverse's products are known for their **beautiful and intuitive design and UX**, so it was a real honour to write code for numerous projects there.

Working in a distributed development team, I developed desktop software projects including [**Filtron**](https://polyversemusic.com/products/filtron/), [**Supermodal**](https://polyversemusic.com/products/supermodal/) and the upcoming **Filterverse** audio effect plugins.
